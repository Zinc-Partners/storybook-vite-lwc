# Procrewz Design System

A modern component library built with Lightning Web Components for Salesforce.

---

## Welcome

The **Procrewz Design System** is a comprehensive collection of reusable UI components built with Lightning Web Components (LWC). It provides a consistent, accessible, and beautiful user experience across all Salesforce applications.

## Features

- 🎨 **Design Tokens** — Centralized token system for colors, typography, spacing, and more
- ⚡ **Lightning Web Components** — Built with LWC for optimal performance
- 📱 **Responsive** — Works beautifully across desktop, tablet, and mobile
- ♿ **Accessible** — Built following WCAG guidelines for inclusive design

## Component Library

Our component library includes essential UI elements:

- **procrewzButton** — Versatile button with multiple variants and sizes
- **procrewzInput** — Form input with validation, masking, and icons
- **procrewzModal** — Dialog/modal with responsive drawer behavior on mobile

## Token Architecture

The design system is powered by `procrewz-design-tokens` which provides a 3-tier token architecture:

1. **Core Tokens** — Base values (colors, primitives)
2. **Semantic Tokens** — Contextual meanings (background, text, border colors)
3. **Component Tokens** — Component-specific values (button padding, input height)
